# Music Advisor
Command line application that uses Spotify API to show music to the user.
### Features
- `new` Shows new music from the Spotify API `new` endpoint. Includes
album name, artist(s), and external URL to visit album Spotify page.
- `featured` Shows featured music from Spotify API `featured-playlists` 
endpoint. Outputs playlist name, external URL to playlist. 
- `categories` Shows a list of valid Spotify categories, 
which can be used to specify a type of playlist.
- `playlist <category>` Shows the user a selection of playlists from the
specified category. Returns an error if unknown category.
- `auth` Access to the above features is denied until the user authenticates
with Spotify and allows access scope to their account. A link to the
Spotify authentication endpoint is presented to the user, which will open
in a web browser and redirect to localhost with a "success" 
or "failure" message directing the user back to the app.
- "Paginated" output. Users receive query results in pages which
can be scrolled through with `next` and `prev`.
    - The number of results on a page is 5 by default but can
    be amended using the command line argument `-page <n>`
